						<p align="justify">RFID has proved to be a useful technology, becoming more common with development of applications that benefit people in everyday useful ways. This project demonstrates the use of this technology to aid human memory, specifically to help people find lost items. Losing a wallet or a mobile phone is a common occurrence for most people, and a system such as this could be beneficial. The system consists of an RFID component which identifies user interactions with objects. This data is used to help people locate lost items through interacting with a lost and found application, which is based on human readable cues. For example, `The user last took their wallet out of their bag at 12:00 along with their car keys'. The cues are constructed based on interactions with such objects. Users view these cues through a web page and also receive alerts on potentially lost items through a built in system display. Results of this research indicate that RFID is a useful and effective technology in such a system. The human readable cues are found to be effective, however they can be supplemented with additional information to improve the system's overall effectiveness.</p>
